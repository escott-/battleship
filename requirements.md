## BattleShip!!

* 2 Players

* Each Player has a 5 x 5 board

* Players will be given 3 ships that are 3 units long and 1 unit wide

* Ships can only be oriented vertically

* The game should take as arguments two arrays of integers representing the ship
placement on each player’s board. Each entry in the array will represent the vertical coordinate of the top of a ship with ­-1 representing an empty column (e.g. [ ­-1 1 2 1 ­-1] would represent 3 ships forming a V shape).

* Players will take turns choosing coordinates to attack
